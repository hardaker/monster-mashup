# Monster Mash Code Arena

This simple [monster code](./game.cpp) code base exists only to tinker
with and learn to create objects in C++ using pointers and to serve as
a place to tinker with function overloading.

# Task ideas

1. READ THE CODE!
   - before doing anything else, make sure you can understand every
     line.  If you can't understand every line, reach out to me and
     ask (6178 folk: find me in the room or on slack).

2. Add a new monster to the potential battles
   - Give it new powers (hp and attack damage)
   - Maybe over-ride one of the functions to do new things

3. Add more monsters!  Why should just 2 battle?
   - ask the user for the number of monsters to put into the arena
   - add that many monsters and have them go for it
   - you might want to add a monster #N counter to the battle print
     out too.
	 
4. Easier to read output
   - the output is quite ugly at the moment.  Maybe a formatted
     closing score card display would be nice?
	 
5. Team battles
   - What if you had two teams with multiple monsters each?
   - What if you had more than two teams?
   
6. Special Attacks
   - What if a monster did two attacks at once (one claw, and one bite
     maybe)?
